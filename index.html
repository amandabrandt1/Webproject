    <h1>My favorite Washington Mountains</h1>

    <p>I love to spend as much time as I can in the mountains. I love to hike, show-shoe, ski, and trail-run. Before
        moving to Utah three years ago, I lived in Washington State and spent much time exploring mountain peaks along
        Mountain Loop Hwy in Snohomish County. One of my favorite mountains to climb was Mt. Dickerman.</p>

    <h2>Mount Dickerman</h2>

        <p>According to <a href=https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/mount-dickerman>Washington Trails Association</a>,
            the Mount Dickerman trail is 8.2 miles long round-trip, with 3950 ft elevation gain, the highest point
            eaching 5760 ft above sea level. I love this trail because of its diverse landscape and scenery. The trail
            begins with about 56 relatively steep switch-backs through a pine forest. I once followed a mountain goat
            along this part of the trail. Once you break the tree line, be prepared for
            spectacular views of surrounding peaks, including glacier-clad Big Four, Vesper Peak, and Mt. Pilchuck. You
            will then continue to climb steadily through fields of mountain blueberries, otherwise known as nature's
            candy, followed by meadows of wildflowers. Be sure to watch for black bears. I have seen several of them
            feasting
            on blueberries and frolicking in the meadows. Once you reach the summit, you will be rewarded with
            green,lush
            valleys and endless mountain peaks in every direction. Especially rewarding are the glaciated peaks of Mount
            Baker and Glacier Peak in the distance, each towering more than 10,500 ft. </p>
